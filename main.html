        <strong>Black hole</strong>
        <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light or other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape it. Since no light can get out, people can't see black holes.The strong gravity occurs because matter has been pressed into a tiny space. Blackhole formation takes place when massive stars die. When the life of a massive star ends, its core becomes unstable and collapses and its outer layers get blown away. There are two kinds of black holes: star-sized black holes and supermassive black holes.</p>
